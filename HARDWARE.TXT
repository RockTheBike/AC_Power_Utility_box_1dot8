connect the plus wire to the inverter to PLUSOUT and the ultracapacitors plus to PLUSRAIL of the current sensor, using thick wires that are heavily soldered to the sensor

but don't overheat the sensor in the process of soldering the thick wires to it.  use the blue 100 watt soldering iron for this!  Weller 100P
