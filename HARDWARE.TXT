the four strip by 12 LED box-lid pedalometer's data wire connects to Arbduino pin 13
the wattmeter (a panel of 8x32 LEDs that displays numbers) data wire connects to Arbduino pin 4
this build works with an external pedalometer from China made of 12 strips of 60 LEDs wired in PARALLEL on Arbduino pin 12

only one transistor in Q2 for the safety relays

connect the plus wire to the inverter to PLUSRAIL and the ultracapacitors plus to PLUSOUT of the current sensor, using thick wires that are heavily soldered to the sensor

but don't overheat the sensor in the process of soldering the thick wires to it.  use the blue 100 watt soldering iron for this!  Weller 100P

install a 3 watt 2.7 ohm resistor (big brown resistor) in D4 instead of a wire jumper

connect the red power wires of both LED strips (watt numeric display and 48-LED pedalometer) to VDD hole on board (not VCC)

install a 2200uF 10V capacitor between VDD hole and ground
