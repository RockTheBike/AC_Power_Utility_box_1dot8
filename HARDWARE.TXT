connect the plus wire to the inverter to PLUSRAIL and the ultracapacitors plus to PLUSOUT of the current sensor, using thick wires that are heavily soldered to the sensor

but don't overheat the sensor in the process of soldering the thick wires to it.  use the blue 100 watt soldering iron for this!  Weller 100P

install a 3 watt 2.7 ohm resistor (big brown resistor) in D4 instead of a wire jumper

connect the red power wires of both LED strips (watt numeric display and 48-LED pedalometer) to VDD hole on board (not VCC)

install a 100uF 25V capacitor between VDD hole and ground
